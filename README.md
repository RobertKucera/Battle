# Battle
A simple game in java

Too run I have Java installed on my computer. You'll need the whole folder titled "Battle" and you'll need to navigate 
to the root folder.  With Java installed you will then type: java Battle

This will begin the game.

Controls:

Pause/break key:  pauses game

up arrow:  move selector up
down arrow: move selector down
The selector determines which of the 3 rows vehicles are built.

On the num pad
0: builds a jeep, cost $150 does low damage and good for capturing flags
1: builds a tank, cost $500 counters AA vehicle
2: builds a plane, cost $500 counters tank
3: builds a AA veilce, cost $500 counters plane

A vehicle can take out 2 of the vehicles it counters assuming all vehicles have full health.
It take 4 jeeps to take out a $500 vehicle.

capture the flag by crossing it with a vehicle for a money bonus

Get vehicles to the opposing HQ to capture and win the game.
player is on the left side.

Game is set to normal difficultly
And can be made harder to easier by changing the code.

Enjoy!
